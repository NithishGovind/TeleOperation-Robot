# Import the standard Python library 'os' for file path manipulations.

# Import ROS 2 utility to get the path of a package's share directory, useful for accessing launch files, URDFs, and config files.

from launch import LaunchDescription
# Import LaunchDescription to define the overall launch description for ROS 2.

from launch.actions import IncludeLaunchDescription, TimerAction
# IncludeLaunchDescription: allows including another launch file within this launch.
# TimerAction: delays the execution of specified actions by a certain period of time.

# Provides a source for a Python-based launch file to be included via IncludeLaunchDescription.

# Command substitution allows running a shell command and using its output as a launch parameter (like fetching robot_description).

# RegisterEventHandler allows executing actions based on certain events in the launch lifecycle (e.g., process start).
